## Week8
- Recursion Tasks
- Frog Game:
There's a lake. N lily-pads are in a series on the lake.  
On the first half pads (starting from the left) are sitting brown frogs (facing right).  
Then there is an empty pad. The second half pads have 3 green frogs on them (facing left).  
The frogs want to pass each other, but they can only jump on the empty lilly pad in the direction they are  
facing or jump over 1 frog on the empty lilly pad behind that frog.  
Write a program that will print all of the jumps that the frogs must do in order to pass each other
